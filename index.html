  <h1>🛕 Unforgettable Memory: 3 Unique Temples in Nusa Penida 🏝️</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><span class="temple-icon">🚗</span>Pura Paluang – The Car Temple</h2>
    <p>Pura Paluang is probably the quirkiest temple in Nusa Penida. Instead of the usual stone shrines, this one has two that look like cars — one shaped like a VW Beetle and another like a Jeep. No, they don’t run on fuel, they run on faith.</p>
    <p>It’s believed these car-shaped shrines are vehicles of Lord Shiva. Locals say the temple has existed for centuries — way before cars even existed. Plot twist: spirituality was ahead of its time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><span class="temple-icon">🕳️</span>Goa Giri Putri – The Hidden Cave Temple</h2>
    <p>This temple is hidden inside a massive cave, but the entrance? Tiny. Like, "am I supposed to crawl into this crack in the rock?" tiny. But once you're inside, boom — it's huge and echoey and magical.</p>
    <p>People come here for meditation, purification, and a serious leg day workout. There’s also holy water believed to have healing power. So yes, it’s a full-body spiritual experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><span class="temple-icon">🌀</span>Pura Krangkeng – The Sacred Cage Temple</h2>
    <p>This temple has a literal cage. Yup — made of metal. It’s used in spiritual rituals to trap negative energy or help people go through cleansing ceremonies. Sounds like therapy, but with extra steps.</p>
    <p>It’s unique, sacred, and just a little spooky — but in a good way. It shows how rich and mystical Balinese Hindu culture can be, especially in Nusa Penida.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌅 Final Words</h2>
    <p>Nusa Penida is not just beaches and cliffs. It’s full of spiritual treasures like these temples — weird, wonderful, and unforgettable. Honestly, this trip changed how I see the island. It’s not just beautiful, it’s magical.</p>
    <p class="camera-look">(Looks into camera) “Next time you visit Nusa Penida, don’t skip the temples. Trust me, they’ve got more plot twists than Netflix.”</p>
